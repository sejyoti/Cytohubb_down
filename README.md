Computational analysis of autophagy genes in human senescence

•Running workflows to focus on the important signalling pathways, molecular activities, and biological processes involving these autophagy regulating genes. 
•By using drugs to see how they influenced autophagy in relation to cancer. 
•The top 10 genes might be used as anti-ageing treatment options
